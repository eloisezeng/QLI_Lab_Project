# Measuring Classical Fisher Information For Estimation of Laser Propagation Direction
--------
sim_img_demo: contains code for generating simulations along with images of the simulations
video_processing: contains data and code for evaluating the classical Fisher Informations for estimating the propagation direction of a laser when our camera collects only atmospherically scattered light.
